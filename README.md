# Skeletons Reworked
Some of you have asked me to make a sequel to Zombies Reworked, but instead of zombies... rework skeletons?? Well after a long time, here it is, and just like it's prequel,
Skeletons Reworked is a mod that overhauls and changes the skeletons in a better way! Ranging from small features to better AI system and better mechanics to make the mod a must need for apocalyptic minecraft modpacks. The mod has similar code to Zombies Reworked, so it's pretty lightweight but also heavy configurable as it does not add that much content!

Skeletons are now immune to the sun, and can spawn with more armor. They... also see you from further away and they can now turn into zombies on death like it should normally be made in Minecraft! The sword or unequipped are also faster!
